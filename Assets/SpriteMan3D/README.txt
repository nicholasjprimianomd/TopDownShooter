Thank you for trying out SpriteMan 3D! We hope you enjoy using it as much as we, it's makers, do.

This free version has the following limitations:
- you can only rig 2-way and 4-way characters (the full version also has 8 and 16-ways)
- the sprite manager core source code is not included (the full version includes FULL source code)
